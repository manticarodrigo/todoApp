todoApp
=======

A remake of https://github.com/arvindr21/todoApp for Angular 4 and Ionic 3.

[Here's a link to Arvind's blog tutorial on re-architechting a Firebase app in Node.js](http://thejackalofjavascript.com/re-architecting-a-firebase-app-in-node)

Run 'ionic serve' in your terminal and in another tab run 'node server.js' in the root directory. Remember to create your own mongoDB instance either locally or on a cloud service like mongolab.
